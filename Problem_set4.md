### Problem Set 3 - CUS715
### Divide and Conquer - Merge Sort.

1. Use merge-sort to sort the following list. Show the actions step by step; and give tree of recursive calls of the algorithm.
  $$123, 34, 189, 56,  150, 12 9, 240 $$

2. Write an algorithm that sorts a list of n items by dividing it into three sublists of about n/3 items, sorting each sublist recursively and merging the three sorted sublists. You can use any programming language you like.

**Deliverable**
If you have not already done so, create a GitHub repository that will host all your assignment for this course. In the repository should create a folder titled `cus715_problem_set_04`. Within that folder, add a `pdf` or `markdown` document with your answers to the problem set. Also, include a subfolder to include the code for the algorithm in exercise 2. Along with the code provide a readme file how to execute your code.
